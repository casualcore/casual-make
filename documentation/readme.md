## introduction
casual-make is the build system used in casual.

We like the descriptive syntax and think it can be a market for it in the open source community.

## technique
It uses python 3 as 'language' and internal 'engine'.

## setup
```
hostname$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/casual-make/source:$PYTHONPATH
hostname$ export PATH=/path/to/casual-make/source:$PATH
```
